## 💡 Project Overview
### About Project
Development of AR content creation software using Unity, utilizing Google ARCore's **Augmented Faces API**. The software attaches assets (stickers) to a person's face visible in the live camera feed, generating AR content in real-time using Google ARCore.
### Project Objective
A project for the technical development to change the AR engine of the existing AR content creation service, `MyPoster`, from the AR engine of Alchera to Google ARCore. Due to increasing dependency on third-party AR engines and rising license costs, which caused difficulties in service expansion, the project aimed to evaluate the feasibility of applying **Google ARCore's augmented face processing technology** to the `MyPoster` service.
